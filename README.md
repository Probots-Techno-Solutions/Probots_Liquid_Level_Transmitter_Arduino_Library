This Submersible level transmitters consist of a sensor attached to a long cable, This is a throw-in type liquid level transmitter that adopts a high-performance pressure sensing chip, with advanced circuit processing and temperature compensation technology. The level transmitter receives different pressures at different depths of liquid, which can be converted into corresponding current signals and output through the sensor. this way, the depth of liquid can be measured, the shell of the transmitter is made of stainless steel, anti-corrosion and easy to clean.
